# odin-sign-up-form
This mock sign-up form was created as part of The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS course.
It's for CloudBox, a fictional cloud storage service.

This web app is [live on GitHub](https://mckathlin.github.io/odin-sign-up-form/).

The form doesn't actually store anything you enter, but for the sake of safety,
I advise against putting actual sensitive information in the form. Just pretend!
